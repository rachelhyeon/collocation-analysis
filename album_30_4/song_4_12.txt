All your expectations of my love are impossible
Surely, you know
That I'm not easy to hold
It's so sad how incapable
Of learning to grow I am
My heart speaks in puzzle and codes
I've been trying my whole life to solve
God only knows how I've cried
I can't take another defeat
A next time would be the ending of me
Now that I see
That love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling)
What a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling again (Fooling)
What a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
How unbelievable (Unbelievable)
Of me to fall for the lies that I tell? (Lies I tell)
The dream that I sell (Dream I sell)
When my heartache, it's inevitable (Inevitable)
But I'm no good at doing it well
Not that I care (I don't care)
Why should anything about it be fair?
When love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling)
What a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling again (Fooling)
What a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
No amount of love
Can keep me satisfied (Satisfied, satisfied)
I can't keep up (I can't keep up, I can't keep up)
When I keep changing my mind
(Change my mind, change my mind)
The feelings flood me to the heights of no compromise
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling)
What a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling)
What a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Oh you know, I'd do it all again
I love it now like I loved it then
I'm a fool for that
You know I'm, you know I'm gonna do it
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I'd do it all again, like I did then
